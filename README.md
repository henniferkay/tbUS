### Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease that's still killing millions of people around the world. 

Due to the Novel Coronavirus that began to spread in the U.S. in 2020, clinics and healthcare facilities had to shut down or steer their resources to COVID. Due to this public health emergency, there was a significant drop in TB cases reported. Given the steady decline in TB cases prior to 2019, we wanted create a forecasting model that estimates less TB cases or a downward trend if COVID had not interrupted TB control efforts.

### Methods
The main aim of this project was to create a model that predicts the number of TB cases and rates following 2019 if COVID had not happened. 

#### Data Sources

The tuberculosis surveillance data from 2000-2022 were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

#### Definitions

According to the CDC, a tuberculosis case is counted as a Confirmed Case if the patient meets the clinical case definition or is laboratory confirmed.

#### Modeling

# Requirements

## Data Model Implementation (25 points)
- A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)  ✓
- The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points) ✓
- The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points) ✓
- The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points) ✓

## Data Model Optimization (25 points)
